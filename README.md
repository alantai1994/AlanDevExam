# VeAsia Client-side – server-side Assessment
From the HTML provided create an application that captures the values below, send them to a back-end application and the back-end returns the same data with the letters capitalized and the time of the order. That information should then be posted into the grey container “order processed”.

- Product Name
- Specifications (names and values)
- SessionId

## Example

## Notes
- You can write all the code and add files that you want, but you cannot modify the existing HTML or CSS of the page.
- Notice that we are just asking for the mandatory content for the test, good developer practices are not required but are taken in account
- We should be able to run the full project in local, take in account that we will review the test in a windows environment, so any dependency that your server needs to run (as release or debug mode) should be included in the project.

### Optional
_Attach any of code you feel proud of. It can be in any language or pseudo-language., Something like a public GitHub profile is also valid._
